## Steps to Run the Project Locally

Follow the steps below to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal (or Git Bash) and run the following command:

```
### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

### 3. Install Dependencies
The project uses Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies. If you don’t have Node.js installed, you can download and install it from Node.js official website.

Once Node.js is installed, run the following command to install the project’s dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the package.json file.

### 4. Run the Development Server
After the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server and open the project in your default web browser. The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

### 5. Access the Application
